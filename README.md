<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A side scroling game using parallax backgrounds, state manamgement and a canvas to draw the game. This game includes logic for multiple different enemy sprite types in addition to the ability to import and use a sprite sheet. Collision detection is also worked into the game, resulting in a state change in the player character. Game over screen is yet to be implimented with final touches, but a score and the timing are functional currentlly.
